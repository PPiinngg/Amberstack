# Amber
Amber is a collection of programs I'm building out of frustration with the current state of technology.

Most of the tools I use on a day to day basis only play nice with one operating system and/or are bloated dumpsterfires that nobody with the drive to actually fix them can touch because they're either closed source or far too large to have a hope in hell of overhauling, so I'm aiming to gradually replace them one by one with my own.

Ideally this project would culminate in a set of tools that are small and light enough for me to build an OS around that can run on a small/cheap risc-V SBC, whether or not I'll ever achieve this in my lifetime is beyond me but I'm going to try regardless.
