;; Shell commands can be executed from a rune script by putting them on their
;; own line with no indentation
rune --eval "(+ 1 2 3 4 5)"

;; This suffices in most basic scripts where you're simply aiming to make
;; a sequence of commonly run commands easily repeatable. However, should
;; you require the ability to construct commands programatically you can do
;; so with string concatenation
(cmd (concat "rune --eval \"(+ "
             (intersperse " " (range 1 5))
             ")\""))
