# Sphene
Sphene is a small ***WORK IN PROGRESS*** DAW tailored towards the creation of bespoke DSP; There is no plugin support and the built-in synths and effects serve more as examples than anything production ready.

## Goals
-[ ] Forth-like stack language for simple effects
-[ ] C-like language for more complicated effects
-[ ] Block based visual language with codeblocks for the other two DSLs
-[ ] Package manager / geode sharing platform
